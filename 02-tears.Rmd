# Model Building

Import data and libraries into R

```{r}
census = read.csv('/Users/lindegaard/Documents/GitHub Repo/exercise01_consolidated.csv')
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(InformationValue)


```

Exploratory Analysis

```{r}
#Perform a simple exploratory analysis and generate summary statistics to get a sense of what is in the data.

#Exploring the types of data
for (x in 1:23) {
  print(colnames(census[x]))
  print(class(census[,x]))
}

# If there are less than 10 levels, factorize the variable
for (x in 1:23) {
  if (length(table(census[,x])) < 10)
  census[,x] = as.factor(census[,x])
}
# Check loop worked
class(census$over_50k)
class(census$marital_status_id)

# Country, occupation and education are currently not a factor

for (x in 1:23) {
  if (class(census[,x]) != "factor") {
    print(colnames(census[x]))
    print(class(census[,x]))
  }
}





```

Split data into training, validation and test

```{r}
#Split the data into a 70/20/10 training, validation, and test data split.
```

Clean data and Develop Model

```{r}
#Develop a model that predicts whether individuals, based on the census variables provided, make over $50,000/year. Use over_50k as the target variable.
#Commit enough code to reproduce your full model selection process, including your final model and all models developed along the way.
```

Create a chart

```{r}
#Create a chart that you feel conveys one important relationship in the data.

```
