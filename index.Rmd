# SQL Data Consolidation

Main objective: Select all variables from the records table and join them with all other tables to consolidate 9 tables into 1

```{sql, output.var="db"}

-- The select statement contains 2 data cleaning steps: 1. Remove redundant columns 2. Rename variables to logical names
SELECT r.id as id, over_50k, age, education_num, capital_gain, capital_loss, hours_week, workclass_id, w.name as workclass, education_level_id, e.name as education_level, marital_status_id, m.name as marital_status, occupation_id, o.name as occupation, relationship_id, rel.name as relationship, race_id, races.name as race, sex_id, s.name as sex, country_id, c.name as country
FROM records as r
-- The left join includes all observations from the records table
LEFT JOIN countries as c ON r.country_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN education_levels as e ON r.education_level_id = e.id
LEFT JOIN marital_statuses as m ON r.marital_status_id = m.id
LEFT JOIN occupations as o ON r.occupation_id = o.id
LEFT JOIN races ON r.race_id = races.id
LEFT JOIN relationships as rel ON r.relationship_id = rel.id
LEFT JOIN sexes as s ON r.sex_id = s.id
LEFT JOIN workclasses as w ON r.workclass_id = w.id;
-- Per instruction, the above statement was exported to CSV

```
